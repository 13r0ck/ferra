# Ferra

Ferra is a visually appealing theme that is inspired by the vibrant colors of [Kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim) and the warm tones of [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox). This theme features a rich palette of earthy browns and greens, accented by subtle pops of blush, coral, and rose. The result is a harmonious blend of colors that is both inviting and easy on the eyes.
